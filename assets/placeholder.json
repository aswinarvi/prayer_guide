    "content": ["Jesus, before he was arrested, prayed to the Father for His disciples and the believers to come. He prayed for their protection from the evil one and for them to be one, as Jesus and the Father are one. Why is this significant? For the world to believe and know that Jesus was indeed sent by God, it is crucial for the body of Christ i.e., the Church, to be one (John 17:20-23).", "It is God's intent to make known His manifold wisdom to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, through the church (Eph 3:10). In order for this to be accomplished, the Church needs to be united. For a kingdom that is divided against itself cannot stand.", "The most excellent way for us to be united, is to walk in the way of love (1 Cor 12; 13; 14:1), just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, the church (Eph 5:1-2). The Spirit dwelling in us enables us to live as such. Though one body, each one of us function differently according to the grace given to us by the Spirit, for the common good. Godâ€™s intent is that the body of Christ may be built up and reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ (Eph 4:3-16).", "In this month, let us take time to pray each day that we become one as Christ intended us to be."]
